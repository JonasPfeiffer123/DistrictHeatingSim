# DistrictHeatingSim

## Introduction

Welcome to the DistrictHeatingSim project, a comprehensive tool for planning and optimizing sustainable district heating networks. This README provides an overview of the project's functionality, installation instructions, and usage guidelines. 

DistrictHeatingSim is developed by Dipl.-Ing. (FH) Jonas Pfeiffer as part of the SMWK-NEUES TG70 project, which focuses on the development and testing of methods and tools for the conceptualization of sustainable heating networks. The software integrates technical and economic simulations to support the design and evaluation of district heating systems.
