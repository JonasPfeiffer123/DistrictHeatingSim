# DistrictHeatingSim

## Introduction

Welcome to the DistrictHeatingSim project, a comprehensive tool for planning and optimizing sustainable district heating networks. This README provides an overview of the project's functionality, installation instructions, and usage guidelines. 

DistrictHeatingSim is developed by Dipl.-Ing. (FH) Jonas Pfeiffer as part of a preliminary research SMWK-NEUES TG70 project, which focuses on the development and testing of methods and tools for the conceptualization of sustainable heating networks. The software integrates technical and economic simulations to support the design and evaluation of district heating systems. Besides the technical methods for calculations, a huge focus lies on implementing a GUI for this process steps. The Tool is implemented as an PyQt5-GUI.

## Installation

To install DistrictHeatingSim, follow the steps below. The software has been tested with Python 3.11. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system before proceeding. Alternatively, you can use Miniconda for managing dependencies.

### Option 1: Install via pip
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Install the repository directly from GitHub using the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/JonasPfeiffer123/DistrictHeatingSim.git
    ```

### Option 2: Manual Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/JonasPfeiffer123/DistrictHeatingSim.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd DistrictHeatingSim
3. Install the required dependencies using the `setup.py` file:
    ```sh
    python setup.py install
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use pip to install the package:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```
4. Run the application by executing the main script:
    ```sh
    python src/districtheatingsim/DistrictHeatingSim.py
    ```

Note that currently the pandapipes-develop branch is used. Reason for this are recent advancements in pandapipes. The current implementation is therefor not compatible with the pandapipes main branch. Further, additional pipetypes where added. These need to be include by replacing the Pipe.csv in "pandapipes\std_types\library" with the Pipe.csv in "DistrictHeatingSim\src\districtheatingsim\data\pandapipes\pipes".

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter errors during installation or while running the application, ensure that all required Python modules are installed. You can install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Verify that all necessary data files are present in the appropriate directories.
- If issues persist, please report them on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/JonasPfeiffer123/DistrictHeatingSim/issues) with detailed information about the error.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install and run DistrictHeatingSim on your system.

    ```

2. ***Install "readthedocs" theme**:
    ```sh
    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

    make html
    ```

The current version of the documentation can be found under https://districtheatingsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. The Sphinx-compatible documentation was created with Copilot using Claude Sonnet 4 (Preview).
