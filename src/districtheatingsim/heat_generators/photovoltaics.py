    Notes
    -----
    Azimuth Convention:
        
        **Solar Energy Standard**:
        The azimuth angle follows solar energy conventions:
        - 0° (South): Maximum annual irradiation in Northern Hemisphere
        - 90° (West): Afternoon energy production optimization
        - 180° (North): Minimal irradiation, typically avoided
        - 270° (East): Morning energy production optimization
        
        **German/European Conventions**:
        - 'O' represents "Ost" (East) in German
        - 'NO' represents "Nordost" (Northeast) in German
        - 'SO' represents "Südost" (Southeast) in German
        
        **Compound Directions**:
        Diagonal orientations (NE, SW, etc.) use intermediate angles
        optimized for balanced daily energy production profiles.

    The function provides robust direction parsing for automated
    building-level PV assessments and system optimization workflows.
