Description: Minimum Spanning Tree generation and road alignment optimization for district heating networks.

This module implements advanced Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms for district heating
network layout optimization. It provides functions to generate cost-optimal tree topologies
from building locations and iteratively adjust network segments to follow existing street
infrastructure while maintaining connectivity and minimizing total construction costs.

The module combines graph theory optimization with geospatial analysis to create practical
network designs that respect infrastructure constraints. It includes network simplification
algorithms and iterative improvement methods for realistic district heating system layouts.

    """
    Generate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from a set of point locations.

    This function creates the optimal tree network connecting all input points with
    minimal total edge length. It uses Euclidean distances between points to build
    a complete graph and applies Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning
    tree that connects all locations with lowest construction cost.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame containing Point geometries representing network terminal locations.
        Typically includes heat consumers, producers, and connection points.

    Returns
    -------
    geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame containing LineString geometries representing the MST network.
        Each line connects two points with minimum total network length.

    Notes
    -----
    Algorithm Properties:
        - Creates tree topology (no cycles) connecting all points
        - Minimizes total network construction length
        - Guarantees connectivity between all network terminals
        - Time complexity: O(nÂ²) for distance calculation, O(E log V) for MST

    Graph Construction:
        1. Creates complete graph with all point-to-point connections
        2. Calculates Euclidean distances as edge weights
        3. Applies NetworkX minimum spanning tree algorithm
        4. Converts resulting edges back to LineString geometries

    Network Properties:
        - Tree structure: n-1 edges for n points
        - Single path between any two points
        - No redundancy or backup connections
        - Optimal for radial distribution systems

    Applications:
        - Initial network topology generation
        - Cost-optimal network design
        - Basis for further optimization and adjustment
        - Comparison baseline for advanced algorithms

    Iteratively adjust MST segments to follow street network infrastructure.

    This function implements an advanced road alignment optimization algorithm that
    modifies MST segments to follow existing street infrastructure while maintaining
    network connectivity. It uses iterative improvement with convergence criteria
    and blacklisting to prevent oscillation and ensure practical network layouts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mst_gdf : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame containing MST segments as LineString geometries.
        Initial tree network to be optimized for road alignment.
    street_layer : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame containing street network as LineString geometries.
        Represents available infrastructure for network routing.
    all_end_points_gdf : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame containing all terminal points for network reconstruction.
        Used for MST rebuilding after segment adjustment.
    threshold : float, optional
        Distance threshold for triggering segment adjustment [m]. Default is 5.0.
        Segments with midpoints farther than this from streets are adjusted.
    min_improvement : float, optional
        Minimum improvement required to accept adjustment [m]. Default is 0.5.
        Prevents marginal adjustments that don't significantly improve alignment.

    Returns
    -------
    geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame with road-aligned network segments maintaining MST connectivity.
        Optimized for following existing street infrastructure.

    Notes
    -----
    Optimization Algorithm:
        1. Identify segments with midpoints far from street network
        2. Project midpoints onto nearest street segments
        3. Split original segments through projected points
        4. Validate improvements against minimum threshold
        5. Apply blacklisting to prevent oscillation
        6. Iterate until convergence or maximum iterations

    Convergence Criteria:
        - No segments require adjustment (within threshold)
        - Maximum iteration limit reached (prevents infinite loops)
        - All problematic segments blacklisted (improvement too small)

    Blacklisting Strategy:
        - Tracks segments that show insufficient improvement
        - Prevents repeated adjustments of same segments
        - Ensures algorithm termination and stability
        - Maintains network quality while avoiding oscillation

    Network Reconstruction:
        - Simplifies adjusted network by merging nearby points
        - Extracts unique points for MST reconstruction
        - Rebuilds MST to ensure tree topology
        - Maintains connectivity while optimizing alignment

    >>>

    >>> improvement = (original_alignment - improved_alignment) / original_alignment * 100
    >>> print(f"Road alignment improved by {improvement:.1f}%")

    >>> # Analyze network changes
    >>> original_length = initial_mst.geometry.length.sum()
